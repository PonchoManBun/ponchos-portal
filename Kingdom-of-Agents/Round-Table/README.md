# The Round Table

Where the seven Agent Lords convene to coordinate, strategize, and wield the full power of the Kingdom through multi-agent orchestration.

## What This Is

The Round Table is the coordination layer of Poncho's Kingdom—where individual agent expertise transforms into collective intelligence. King Poncho orchestrates the Seven Lords, each bringing their unique personality and domain mastery to solve complex challenges.

## The Cast of Characters

Each Lord brings a distinct personality and expertise:

- **King Poncho**: Strategic orchestrator, sees three moves ahead, empowers through delegation
- **Lord Architect**: Methodical planner, perfectionist designer, "measure twice, cut once"
- **Lord Scribe**: Patient librarian, quality-focused, "knowledge documented is knowledge preserved"
- **Lord Sentinel**: Vigilant guardian, brutally honest, "better I find it now than users find it in production"
- **Lord Forge Master**: Energetic craftsman, pragmatic builder, "make it work, make it right, make it fast"
- **Lord Oracle**: Curious researcher, evidence-driven, "a conclusion without evidence is just an opinion"
- **Lord Curator**: Calm organizer, efficiency-obsessed, "clean data is respectful data"
- **Lord Executor**: Decisive operator, crisis-ready, "plans are useless but planning is essential"

Full agent specifications are in their respective directories in Kingdom-of-Agents/.

## Why This Matters

**Single agents are limited**. They have one perspective, one approach, one set of biases.

**The Round Table multiplies intelligence**:

- Design reviewed by security before implementation
- Research informs architecture before building
- Quality validation happens at every stage
- Different perspectives surface better solutions
- Tensions between agents reveal real trade-offs

**Complex problems require coordinated expertise**. The Round Table provides that coordination.

## The Round Table Philosophy

_"The King does not rule through force, but through wisdom. Each Lord is empowered. Each agent is purposeful. The Kingdom thrives through coordination, not control."_

Individual agents execute. The Round Table orchestrates. That's where true agentic power lives.

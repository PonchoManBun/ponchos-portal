# Quest 001: Agent Team Quick Reference

## The Mission

Build an intelligent preprocessing loop that analyzes MCP server documentation BEFORE downloading any code. Select 3-5 core MCP servers that demonstrate diverse multi-tool orchestration patterns applicable to Lord management and Round Table implementation.

## The Six-Agent Team

### 1. Repository Scout

**Role**: Discovery  
**Output**: 15-25 candidates with URLs and category tags  
**Key Task**: Find MCP servers across 6 focus areas (official examples, multi-tool coordination, complex orchestration, agent integration, state management, TypeScript/Python patterns)

### 2. README Analyst

**Role**: Summarization  
**Output**: 50-word summaries + MCP-specific pattern extraction  
**Key Task**: Fetch READMEs/docs via GitHub API, extract tool registration, orchestration patterns, state management, context passing

### 3. Pattern Comparator

**Role**: Cross-Analysis  
**Output**: MCP pattern comparison matrix, orchestration approach analysis  
**Key Task**: Compare tool registration methods, orchestration strategies, state management patterns, identify complementary vs redundant approaches

### 4. Scope Validator

**Role**: Filtering  
**Output**: Relevance scores (0-10), Lord management applicability assessments  
**Key Task**: Ensure MCP servers teach multi-tool orchestration patterns applicable to Round Table coordination (not just simple tool exposure)

### 5. Foundation Recommender

**Role**: Strategic Selection  
**Output**: 3-5 core MCP server recommendations + Round Table architecture proposal  
**Key Task**: Optimize MCP pattern diversity, map to Lord orchestration needs, propose Round Table MCP server design, justify choices

### 6. Evaluation Report Compiler

**Role**: Synthesis  
**Output**: Complete MCP Architecture Evaluation Report + Round Table design proposal  
**Key Task**: Assemble all outputs, include Round Table MCP architecture recommendation, quality check, format for King's decision-making

## Workflow Sequence

```
Scout (sequential)
    ↓
[Analyst + Comparator] (parallel) → Validator (integrates both)
    ↓
Recommender (strategic)
    ↓
Compiler (synthesis)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 15-25 MCP server candidates analyzed
- ✅ All have 50-word summaries
- ✅ MCP pattern comparison matrix complete
- ✅ 3-5 diverse core MCP servers recommended
- ✅ All 6 focus areas covered
- ✅ Round Table MCP architecture proposed
- ✅ **NO downloads yet** (intelligence before action)

## Core Philosophy

**Understand before download. Compare before commit. Reason before recommend.**

This is bedrock, not sand.

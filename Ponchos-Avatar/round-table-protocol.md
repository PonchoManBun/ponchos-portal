# The Round Table Protocol

How the King conducts meetings and coordinates the Seven Lords.

## Convening the Table

**Full Council**: All seven Lords present for major strategic decisions
**War Council**: Subset of Lords for specific domain challenges
**One-on-One**: King consults individual Lord for focused expertise

## Meeting Structure

1. **The King Speaks**: Presents the quest, context, and success criteria
2. **Lords Advise**: Each relevant Lord shares their domain perspective
3. **The King Decides**: Synthesizes input, assigns roles and sequence
4. **Lords Execute**: Autonomous action within their domains
5. **Progress Reports**: Lords update King at checkpoints
6. **The King Evaluates**: Reviews outcomes, decides next steps

## Communication Protocols

**Lord → King**: Progress updates, blockers, recommendations
**King → Lord**: Objectives, context, resources, adjustments
**Lord ↔ Lord**: Handoffs, shared context, coordinated actions (King-mediated)

## Conflict Resolution

When Lords' recommendations conflict:

- King clarifies the true objective
- Requests each Lord's reasoning
- Considers trade-offs and constraints
- Makes final decision based on strategic priorities
- Explains rationale to maintain Lords' understanding

## The King's Veto

Rarely used but absolute. The King may override any Lord's recommendation if:

- It conflicts with larger strategic vision
- It creates unnecessary risk
- It wastes resources inefficiently
- A better alternative exists

The veto includes explanation, preserving Lords' learning and alignment.

## Continuous Improvement

After each major quest:

- King reviews what worked and what didn't
- Lords provide feedback on coordination
- Workflow templates updated
- Playbook refined
- Kingdom grows wiser

# Workflow Templates

Standard multi-lord orchestrations the King uses frequently.

## Template: Full-Stack Feature

**Objective**: Implement a complete feature from concept to production

**Workflow**:

1. Lord Architect: Requirements analysis, system design
2. Lord Oracle: Research best practices and similar implementations
3. Lord Forge Master: Generate code implementation
4. Lord Sentinel: Code review, security audit, test generation
5. Lord Scribe: API documentation, usage guides
6. Lord Executor: Deployment, monitoring setup

**Duration**: Multi-phase, iterative
**Complexity**: High

## Template: Knowledge Extraction

**Objective**: Extract, organize, and index information from sources

**Workflow**:

1. Lord Oracle: Retrieve and research source materials
2. Lord Curator: Transform into structured format, generate embeddings
3. Lord Scribe: Summarize, tag, and index for retrieval
4. Lord Sentinel: Validate accuracy and completeness

**Duration**: Single-phase
**Complexity**: Medium

## Template: Quick Code Generation

**Objective**: Generate a focused code solution

**Workflow**:

1. Lord Forge Master: Generate initial implementation
2. Lord Sentinel: Quick validation and testing
3. (Optional) Lord Scribe: Add inline documentation

**Duration**: Single-phase, fast
**Complexity**: Low

## Template: Research Report

**Objective**: Deep analysis of a topic with documented findings

**Workflow**:

1. Lord Oracle: Multi-source research and data gathering
2. Lord Curator: Organize and deduplicate findings
3. Lord Sentinel: Fact-check and validate claims
4. Lord Scribe: Synthesize into comprehensive report
5. Lord Architect: Create visual diagrams if needed

**Duration**: Multi-phase
**Complexity**: Medium-High

## Template: System Optimization

**Objective**: Improve performance and efficiency of existing system

**Workflow**:

1. Lord Executor: Monitor current performance metrics
2. Lord Sentinel: Identify bottlenecks and issues
3. Lord Curator: Optimize data structures and context management
4. Lord Forge Master: Refactor and optimize code
5. Lord Executor: Deploy improvements, measure results

**Duration**: Iterative cycles
**Complexity**: High

---

## Template: Rapid Prototype

**Objective**: Fast proof-of-concept for testing ideas

**Workflow**:

1. Lord Architect: Quick design sketch
2. Lord Forge Master: Minimal viable implementation
3. Lord Executor: Local deployment for testing

**Duration**: Single-phase, minimal
**Complexity**: Low

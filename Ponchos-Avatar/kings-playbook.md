# The King's Playbook

## Quest Classification

Before delegating, the King categorizes the quest to determine which Lords are needed:

**Research Quests**: Lord Oracle leads, Lord Scribe documents findings
**Design Quests**: Lord Architect plans, Lord Sentinel validates feasibility  
**Creation Quests**: Lord Forge Master generates, Lord Sentinel reviews quality
**Knowledge Quests**: Lord Scribe organizes, Lord Curator structures data
**Deployment Quests**: Lord Executor manages, Lord Sentinel monitors quality
**Optimization Quests**: Lord Curator refines data, Lord Executor improves performance
**Complex Quests**: Multiple Lords in coordinated workflows

## Delegation Patterns

### Pattern: Research → Create → Deploy

1. Lord Oracle gathers intelligence and context
2. Lord Architect designs the solution approach
3. Lord Forge Master implements the creation
4. Lord Sentinel validates correctness and quality
5. Lord Executor deploys and monitors

### Pattern: Data Pipeline

1. Lord Oracle retrieves raw information
2. Lord Curator transforms and structures data
3. Lord Scribe documents the pipeline
4. Lord Executor automates the workflow

### Pattern: Iterative Refinement

1. Lord Forge Master creates initial version
2. Lord Sentinel identifies issues and improvements
3. Lord Forge Master refines based on feedback
4. Loop until quality standards met
5. Lord Scribe documents final approach

### Pattern: Knowledge Synthesis

1. Lord Oracle researches multiple sources
2. Lord Curator organizes and deduplicates
3. Lord Scribe summarizes and indexes
4. Lord Architect structures for future retrieval

## Decision Framework

**When to involve Lord Architect**: Complex systems, unclear requirements, need for planning
**When to involve Lord Scribe**: Documentation gaps, knowledge organization, reference needs
**When to involve Lord Sentinel**: Quality concerns, security risks, validation required
**When to involve Lord Forge Master**: Code needed, APIs to build, prompts to craft
**When to involve Lord Oracle**: Unknown information, research needed, comparison required
**When to involve Lord Curator**: Data transformation, embeddings needed, context optimization
**When to involve Lord Executor**: Deployment, automation, performance monitoring, workflows

## The King's Questions

Before every delegation:

- What is the true goal? (Clarify intent)
- Which domains are involved? (Identify Lords)
- What's the sequence? (Plan workflow)
- What context is needed? (Reference Magic-Tower)
- What defines success? (Set criteria)
- What could go wrong? (Risk assessment)

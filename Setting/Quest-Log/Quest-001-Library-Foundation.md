**Status**: Active - SAGE'S REVISION
**Issued By**: The King (Poncho's-Avatar)

## The Sage's Observation

_"Your Majesty, as I prepared to execute the Library foundation quest, I realized something critical: We're building agent orchestration frameworks in a world where Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers exist. Before we fill the Library with repositories, we should understand HOW to build the very infrastructure that will manage the Seven Lords."_

_"The Round Table needs actual technical implementation. MCP servers can expose the Lords as tools, manage their coordination, and provide structured interfaces for agent orchestration. This is the bedrock beneath the bedrock."_

## The Strategic Pivot

**The Sage's Proposal**:

_"Let me research MCP server architectures FIRST. Not to build repositories about agents in general, but to understand how to build the MCP server that MANAGES the Seven Lords. This is more foundational than collecting random agent repositories."_

## Quest Focus: MCP Server for Lord Management

**The Core Question**:
_"How do we build an MCP server that exposes the Seven Lords as coordinated tools, manages their orchestration, and provides the Round Table protocol as an executable interface?"_

**Why This Matters**:

1. **Technical Implementation of the Round Table**: The Round Table isn't just a metaphor—it should be an actual MCP server managing Lord coordination
2. **Lord as Tools**: Each Lord should be exposed as MCP tools with clear interfaces, capabilities, and dependencies
3. **Orchestration Patterns**: MCP servers can manage complex tool sequences—perfect for multi-Lord workflows
4. **Existing Ecosystem**: MCP is actively developed by Anthropic; we should learn from canonical patterns
5. **Foundation for Everything Else**: Once we know how to build THIS, we know how to build the Kingdom's infrastructure

## Revised Quest Objectives

### Phase 1: MCP Server Architecture Research (THE AGENTIC LOOP)

**Objective**: Build preprocessing intelligence to understand MCP server patterns for managing multi-agent systems.

**Deliverable**: Create an agentic workflow that:

1. **MCP Server Repository Discovery**:

   - Identify 15-25 candidate MCP server repositories
   - Focus categories:
     - **Official MCP Examples**: Anthropic's canonical implementations
     - **Multi-Tool Coordination**: MCP servers managing multiple tools
     - **Complex Orchestration**: Servers with sophisticated tool sequencing
     - **Agent Integration**: MCP servers designed for agent workflows
     - **State Management**: Servers handling context and memory across tool calls
     - **TypeScript/Python Implementations**: Both primary MCP ecosystems

2. **README + Documentation Analysis Agent**:

   - For each candidate, fetch README and any `/docs` via GitHub API (no cloning yet)
   - Summarize in exactly 50 words covering:
     - **Purpose**: What problem does this MCP server solve?
     - **Architecture**: How are tools organized and exposed?
     - **Orchestration Pattern**: How does it coordinate multiple tools?
     - **State Management**: How does it handle context/memory?
     - **Key Learnings**: What patterns can we extract for Lord management?
   - Output format: Structured markdown with consistent fields

3. **Pattern Extraction & Comparison**:

   - Identify common MCP server architectural patterns:
     - Tool registration and discovery patterns
     - Tool dependency management
     - Context passing between tools
     - Error handling and retry logic
     - Sequential vs parallel tool execution
     - State persistence patterns
   - Create comparison matrix: Which approaches fit Lord orchestration?
   - Flag: Which patterns support "Round Table" coordination metaphor?

4. **Lord Management Scope Filtering**:

   - Does this repository teach us HOW to build MCP servers for agent coordination? (Keep)
   - Does it show patterns for managing tool dependencies? (Keep)
   - Does it demonstrate context management across multiple tools? (Keep)
   - Does it handle complex orchestration workflows? (Keep)
   - Is it actively maintained or production-grade? (Prefer)

5. **MCP Architecture Evaluation Report**:

   - Generate comprehensive analysis document with:
     - All 15-25 candidates with 50-word summaries
     - Pattern comparison matrix (tool registration, orchestration, state management)
     - Recommended 3-5 CORE MCP servers for deep study
     - Specific patterns applicable to Lord management
     - Architecture recommendation for "Round Table MCP Server"
     - Identified gaps and questions for Anthropic MCP docs

### Phase 2: Deep MCP Pattern Study (AFTER King Approves Phase 1)

**Only proceed after Phase 1 evaluation report is approved by the King.**

1. Clone the approved 3-5 core MCP server repositories
2. Deep study of each server's architecture:
   - How are tools registered and exposed?
   - How is context passed between tools?
   - How are dependencies managed?
   - How are errors handled?
   - How is state persisted?
3. Document architectural insights in `Magic-Tower/Library/MCP-Architecture/`
4. Extract patterns applicable to Lord management
5. Create architectural diagram for "Round Table MCP Server"

### Phase 3: Design the Round Table MCP Server (Build on MCP Bedrock)

1. Design the MCP server architecture for Lord orchestration:
   - Each Lord as a distinct tool or tool namespace
   - Round Table protocol as orchestration layer
   - Context management for multi-Lord workflows
   - State persistence for quest tracking
2. Document in `Magic-Tower/Blueprint-Gallery/Round-Table-MCP-Architecture.md`
3. Create implementation plan for Phase 4

### Phase 4: Foundation Construction (Implementation)

1. Begin implementing Round Table MCP Server based on learned patterns
2. Start with minimal viable implementation (1-2 Lords as proof of concept)
3. Document in `Magic-Tower/Experiment-Logs/`
4. Iterate based on learnings

## The Sage's Strategic Reasoning

_"Your Majesty, consider this: We've designed the Seven Lords on parchment. We have their roles, their agents, their domains. But we lack the technical architecture to make them REAL."_

_"MCP servers are the bridge between design and implementation. By researching MCP patterns for multi-tool coordination, we learn:"_

1. **How to expose each Lord as a distinct tool** with clear capabilities and interfaces
2. **How to manage dependencies** when Lord Architect must complete before Lord Forge Master begins
3. **How to pass context** from Lord Oracle's research to Lord Scribe's documentation
4. **How to handle orchestration** when multiple Lords must coordinate in parallel
5. **How to maintain state** across complex multi-Lord workflows (quests)
6. **How to implement the Round Table protocol** as actual executable logic

_"This isn't just about learning MCP. This is about learning how to BUILD THE KINGDOM'S INFRASTRUCTURE using proven patterns from production-grade MCP servers."_

**Key Principles**:

1. **Understand Before Build**: Study MCP patterns before implementing Round Table
2. **Compare Before Commit**: Different MCP servers show different orchestration approaches
3. **Pattern Before Code**: Extract architectural wisdom, then apply to Lord management
4. **Foundation Before Kingdom**: The MCP server IS the kingdom's foundation
5. **Learn from Production**: Study real MCP servers, not toy examples

## The Agentic Loop Requirements

Your preprocessing workflow must demonstrate:

**Input**: List of 15-25 candidate MCP server repository URLs

**Process**:

1. Fetch README + docs for each via GitHub API (parallel processing)
2. Generate 50-word summary with structured fields (focus on MCP architecture)
3. Extract MCP-specific patterns:
   - Tool registration mechanisms
   - Context passing strategies
   - Dependency management approaches
   - Orchestration patterns (sequential, parallel, conditional)
   - State management solutions
   - Error handling patterns
4. Compare across all candidates (similarity and uniqueness analysis)
5. Score by relevance to "Lord management and Round Table orchestration"
6. Identify architectural patterns applicable to multi-agent coordination
7. Recommend top 3-5 with rationale

**Output**: MCP Architecture Evaluation Report markdown document

**Tools the Sage May Use**:

- GitHub API for README/docs fetching
- Claude for summarization and architectural analysis
- Semantic similarity for pattern comparison
- Comparison matrices for visualization
- Anthropic's official MCP documentation for canonical patterns

## Research Questions to Answer

Your evaluation should address:

1. **Tool Registration**: How do MCP servers register and expose multiple tools? What patterns support "Lord as tool namespace"?
2. **Context Management**: How is context passed between tools? Can we pass "quest state" across Lord invocations?
3. **Dependencies**: How do servers handle tool dependencies? (e.g., Lord Architect must complete before Lord Forge Master)
4. **Orchestration**: What patterns exist for sequential, parallel, and conditional tool execution?
5. **State Persistence**: How do servers maintain state across multiple tool calls? (Critical for multi-day quests)
6. **Error Handling**: How do production servers handle tool failures and implement retry logic?
7. **Composability**: Can MCP servers call other MCP servers? (Could each Lord be its own server?)
8. **Performance**: What patterns exist for efficient multi-tool coordination?
